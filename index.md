This blog is a log of the assignments for the Harvard College class Government 1347: Election Analytics taught by Dr. Ryan Enos. The blog will be updated every Saturday throughout the fall semester of 2020. 


# [The Election Forecast](Posts/prediction.html)
This is my prediction for the 2020 election. I build a probabilistic model that includes correlation between states, based on a host of economic, demographic, and polling data. 

# [Model Postmortem](Posts/postmortem.html)
The postmortem of my model, assessing what went right, what went wrong, and what I should have done to correct my mistakes.


# [Pre-Election Blog Posts](https://samthau.github.io/gov1347/)

# [1. Introduction](Posts/Introduction.html)
An introduction to the blog. Covers different ways to think about election results. Includes a discussion of "tipping point states."

# [2. Economy](Posts/Economy_post.html)
Models using the economy to predict election outcomes. National and state by state regressions of various forms.

# [3. Polls](Posts/polls.html)
Incorporating polls into linear regressions, following similarly to the pervious post. Shows how in certain models, including polls increases model accuracy at the state level.

# [4. Incumbency](Posts/incumbency.html)
Discussions of incumbency in the 2020 election, along with an introduction to probabilistic models.

# [5. Probabilistic Models](Posts/prob1.html)
Examination of a binomial model, and thinking about some alternate models that may be useful in the coming weeks. 

# [6. Empirical Bayes](Posts/prob2.html)
Examination of a beta-binomial model, estimated using hierarchical empirical Bayes. 

# [7. Parties and Uncertainty](Posts/polarization.html)
An examination of the predictive power of different two sided models over time. In addition, I take yet another crack at a probabilistic model, this time with some success in introducing variance. 

# [Appendix](Posts/appendix.html)
A running log of content that does not quite fit into the blog. If updated to go along with a post, a note will be made in the corresponding blog post. Last updated for [7. Parties and Uncertainty](Posts/polarization.html).
